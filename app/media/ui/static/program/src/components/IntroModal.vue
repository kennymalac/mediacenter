                <p>Flatlanders is a content network that emphasizes content discovery and creativity. Publishing content on Flatlanders is an opportunity to broadcast your voice to other likeminded individuals. Now just how does Flatlanders do things differently?</p>

                <h3>Feeds</h3>
                <p>Content discovery takes place here. Your account will start out with a single feed called "My Feed" which will contain any content you have ever uploaded to the site. Creating a Feed will allow you to filter content coming in from the rest of the network. Create multiple Feeds for your different sets of interests.</p>

                <h3>Groups</h3>
                <p>Groups are where most interactions will take place. You can create a Group or discover a Group by Interests. Groups have a single owned Feed with content that pertains to a specific set of Interests. Many Groups can exist with the same Interests.</p>

                <h3>Places</h3>
                <p>Upon connecting your location, you will gain the ability to browse content within your local area. Currently this is limited to users and groups within a 100 mile radius of you.</p>

                <h3>Users</h3>
                <p>This should be self-explanatory. This is a list of other users on the website!</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center"><i>Have fun!</i></h3>

                <p>Please keep in mind this is a very early release, and Flatlanders' success depends <b>on you</b>.</p>
