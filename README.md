Media Center
=================
This is a web application that hosts a registration server for viewing and uploading user content. When hosted on a private server, it provides the following features:
* Web video conferencing through WebRTC
* Photo uploading with integrated photo gallery
* Social feeds through subscriptions to user posts
* Blog hosting and activity logs
* Social interaction through commenting and sharing public links

This web app is implemented using Django and Python, with the primary library used being Django REST Framework. The frontend uses Vue.js.

Currently few of these features are fully implemented and progress is being made on all fronts.
